# fe-nc-news-website

Welcome!

This app is a front-end articles website where users can perform basic CRUD operations, such as voting, commenting, and deleting comments.

This project was my first attempt at building a front-end application, created using React in combination with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It interacts with a backend server, which was also specifically developed for this project.

You can find the backend server at the following URL: [https://guys-app.onrender.com/api/](url)

Also, the code for the backend can be found at: [https://github.com/guidopro/nc-news-project](url)

The minimum required version of Node to run the project locally is v22.13.0.

To run the project locally, please follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/guidopro/fe-nc-news-website.git`

Install the required dependencies:

`npm install`

Start the development server:

`npm run dev`

Thank you for checking out this project!
